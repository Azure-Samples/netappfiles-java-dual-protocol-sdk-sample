# Azure NetAppFiles SDK Sample - Dual-Protocol for Java

This project demonstrates how to use a Java sample application to create a Dual-Protocol Volume (a Volume that uses both SMB/NFS protocol types)
for the Microsoft.NetApp resource provider. 

In this sample application we perform the following operations: 

* Creations
    * ANF Account
    * Capacity Pool
    * Dual-Protocol Volume
* Deletions
    * Dual-Protocol Volume
    * Capacity Pool
    * ANF Account

>Note: The cleanup execution is disabled by default. If you want to run this end to end with the cleanup, please
>change value of boolean variable 'cleanup' in main.java

If you don't already have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can get a FREE trial account [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330212).

## Prerequisites

1. This project is built upon Maven, which has to be installed in order to run the sample. Instructions on installing Maven can be found on their website [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
1. The sample is written in Java 11. The Maven compiler's target Java version is therefore Java 11, and the JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set to Java 11 or a newer version.
Instructions on setting JAVA_HOME can be found [here](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-on-windows-10/) for windows,
and [here](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-environment-variable-on-mac-os-x/) for macOS.
1. Make sure you comply with the dual-protocol items described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/create-volumes-dual-protocol#considerations) before you proceed.
1. Have the Root CA certificate used by the AD Domain Controller and the Windows clients exported as Base64 encoded X.509 certificate file.
If unsure, steps 2-3 in [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/create-volumes-dual-protocol#upload-active-directory-certificate-authority-public-root-certificate) document shows how to export the certificate.
Make sure this file is stored at the root of the project.
1. Azure subscription
1. Subscription needs to have Azure NetApp Files resource provider registered. For more information, see [Register for NetApp Resource Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register).
1. Subscription needs to be enabled for Azure NetApp Files. For more information, please refer to
[this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register#waitlist) document
1. Resource Group created
1. Virtual Network with a delegated subnet to Microsoft.Netapp/volumes resource. For more information. please refer to
[Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-network-topologies)
1. For this sample console application to work we need to authenticate. We will be using Service Principal based authentication
    1. Within an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) session, make sure
    you're logged on at the subscription where you want to be associated with the service principal by default:
        ```bash
        az account show
       ```
         If this is not the correct subscription, use             
         ```bash
        az account set -s <subscription name or id>  
        ```
    1. Create a service principal using Azure CLI
        ```bash
        az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth
        ```
       
       >Note: This command will automatically assign RBAC contributor role to the service principal at subscription level.
       You can narrow down the scope to the specific resource group where your tests will create the resources.

   1. Set the following environment variables from the output of the creation:

      Powershell
       ```powershell
       $env:AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = <subscriptionId>
       $env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID = <clientId>
       $env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = <clientSecret>
       $env:AZURE_TENANT_ID = <tenantId>
       ```
      Bash
       ```bash
       export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subscriptionId>
       export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<clientId>
       export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<clientSecret>
       export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenantId>
       ```
    
## What is netappfiles-java-dual-protocol-sdk-sample doing?

This sample is dedicated to demonstrate how to create a dual-protocol Volume using an ANF Account name in Azure NetApp Files.
Dual-protocol volumes use both SMB and NFS protocol types.
Similar to other ANF SDK examples, the authentication method is based on a service principal. This project will first create an
ANF Account with an Active Directory object using the Root CA certificate mentioned in the prerequisites section.
Then a capacity pool is created, and finally a single dual-protocol volume using Standard service level tier.
When executing this application, the user will be prompted to provide the password for the Active Directory User that has permission to domain join computers in AD.

There is a section in the code dedicated to remove created resources. By default this script will not remove all created resources;
this behavior is controlled by a boolean variable called 'cleanup' in the main class. If you want to erase all resources right after the
creation operations, set this variable to 'true'.
If any of the earlier operations fail for any reason, the cleanup of resources will have to be done manually.

>Note: This sample does not have a specific retrieve section since we perform get operations in several
>places throughout the code.

## How the project is structured
